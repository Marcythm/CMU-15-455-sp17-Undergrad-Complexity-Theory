<B> Course description and homework expectations</B><p>

The course will overlap significantly with "Part 3: Complexity" of Sipser's textbook.  Topics will include models of computation (Turing Machines, circuits, ...), time and space complexity; hierarchy theorems by diagonalization; P vs. NP; theorems of Ladner, Mahaney, Savitch, Immerman-Szelepcsényi; randomized computation; and, the polynomial-time hierarchy.  We will also cover some non-traditional topics of current research interest, such as the Exponential Time Hypothesis, Feige's Hypothesis, and fine-grained complexity.<p>

As in theoretical courses such as 15-251, this class emphasizes writing clear and correct mathematical proofs.  Sipser's book uses a nice "2-part format" for proofs:  It begins with a 1-paragraph "high-level idea" of the proof; then the second part gives the full proof details.  I highly recommend you follow the same strategy for your homework proofs!  Please note that sometimes in class, I may only present <i>some</i> of the full details ("second part") of a proof.  However it is expected that your homework solutions will contain full proof details.

<B> Well-being and happiness</B><p>
Your well-being and happiness is very important to us at CMU, and there are <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/healthwellness.html">many resources</a> to help you with it.  Please contact me directly if you need assistance or would like to talk about any such issues.


<hr>
<B> Homework policies</B><p>

You must complete all homework problems <b>by yourself</b>.<p>

You <b>may</b>:
<ul>  
  <li> Discuss the problems with the course instructors at office hours to whatever extent they allow.</li>
  <li> Ask thoughtful questions or for clarifications on Piazza.  (Do not reveal aspects of the solution in public posts, though!) </li> 
  <li>  Discuss high-level concepts with other students in the course. </li> 
  <li> Look at written sources (textbooks, Wikipedia, etc.) for general/high-level concepts (e.g., "nondeterminism", "universal Turing machine").</li> 
</ul>

You may <b>not</b>:
<ul>
  <li>  Communicate with any person outside the class about the problems. </li> 
  <li>  Share solution details with any other student. </li>
  <li>  Search on the internet for <b>specific</b> homework problems. </li>
</ul>

We assume that by now you are fully familiar with the <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/academic_integrity.html">university policies</a> on <a href = "https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/acad_standards/creative/cheating.html">academic integrity</a>, which of course are in effect. Please contact us directly if you need any clarifications.<p>

<hr>
<B> Homework mechanics</B><p>

All homework will be submitted using <a href = "http://gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>.  Please your andrew id as your identifier.  If you have not been enrolled into the course on Gradescope, please contact us on Piazza.  Your homework must be submitted as a pdf (each problem on a separate page or pages).  You can use LaTeX or another math-document-editor to produce your homework pdf, or you can photograph/scan handwritten solutions.  <a href="gradescope_submitting_hw_guide.pdf">Here are instructions for submitting to Gradescope</a>.  Here's a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wemznvGPfg">video</a>, if that helps. <i>Please be sure to mark which pages correspond to which questions in Gradescope after uploading your pdf.</i><p>

Each student will be allotted <b>6 late days</b> for the entire semester.  At most 2 late days may be used on any one homework.  Please use late days when you really need them, as we cannot accept late homework for any other reason.<p>

<i>How to use late days</i>:  Gradescope doesn't have the greatest system for late days.  Here's how it will work.  Homework is typically due on Thursdays at 5pm.  However the Gradescope "due date" will be set to Saturday at 5pm, to facilitate use of late days.  <b>To submit "on time", you must electronically submit by Thursday 5pm, and must not re-submit any time after that.</b>  Gradescope records the <i>last</i> date/time at which you submitted.  (You can also see your submission time on Gradescope by going to "Submission History".)  Homework submitted past the "real" due date (typically Thursday 5pm) will incur either 1 or 2 late days.  Anything from Thursday 5:01pm to Friday 5:00pm incurs 1 late day; anything from Friday 5:01pm to Saturday 5:00pm incurs 2 late days.  <i>After Saturday 5:00pm it will be impossible for you to submit, and you will get a 0 for the homework.</i>  If you are using late days you do not need to do anything special beyond submitting.  The TAs have access to the time of your submission and will deduct late days accordingly.  Nevertheless, <i>you are responsible for knowing how many late days you've used</i>.  Gradescope does not know about late days, so it <i>will</i> allow you to submit late even if you've used up all your late days.  If this happens, the TAs will detect this and simply give your homework a grade of 0.
